just use the cmd line

python2 -c "print('A' * 270)" | nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 31045

works because auth puts the entire name into memory, and then puts the null-terminator wherever we put the \n
so just make the name go way over the password as well, so then the name's null terminator comes after the password

so when it prints the name, it also leaks the password


or whatever, something like that

picoCTF{aLw4y5_Ch3cK_tHe_bUfF3r_s1z3_d1667872}
